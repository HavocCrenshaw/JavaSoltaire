# JavaSolitaire
JavaSolitaire is a basic Solitaire game made in Java. It serves simply as a
learning project, and a fun project. I wanted to learn Java, I wanted
simple Solitaire. Hence, JavaSolitaire.

## Dependencies
JavaSolitaire uses LWJGL 3.3.6 for graphics & audio, and was created with
the Java SE 25 OpenJDK available on the Oracle website.

## So...
No guarantees this works, especially on YOUR computer. I don't know Java,
I don't really care about like this as a "production" project, I'm just
throwing something together for fun and open sourcing it. So I hope it
works for you if you dare to build it, but no guarantee.
